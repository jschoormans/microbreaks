In 1885, the German psychologist Herman Ebinghaus discovered something very peculiar. He was a psychologist who was very interested in the study of memory. In one of his experiments, he compared 38 repetitions over three days, with 68 repetitions all in one go. The result in memory perfomance was the same. 
So, the time between learning, or spacing interval, seems as important as the time spent studying.  

It is well known that more repetitions improve memory. Unfortunately, repetitions have diminishing returns.

It has been shown that two spaced learning sessions can be twice as efficient as two learning session without spacing.[^1] Moreover this so-called ***spacing effect*** seems to be very general between types of learning. Whether it is language learning, mathematics, or difficult choreographies!

Twice as efficient? That's great! So, why do we need rest in between learning?

## üò¥ What happens during rest?

> Much, if not all skill learning occurs [...] during rest.  [^2]

During rest,the neurons in the brain are rewired. It is sometimes explained as more repetitions - i.e. while resting after learning something, the events will be re-played.

The actual physical rewiring of the brain is crucial for long-term memory. This rewiring mostly happens during periods of sleep. However, we now know that even very short wakeful rest states can make a big difference!

In one recent experiment[^2], Hippocampal replay, or the replaying of events, was studied in participants who were asked to practice a simple finger motion exercise. Every so often, the participants were asked to take a 10-second micro break. At the same time, their brain activity was measured with an MEG. It was found that, during these short rest states, the brain activity mimiced the activity during the exercise, but 10 to 20 times faster! Meaning, that in those short micro rests, the exercise was played back in the brain, very fast! This lead to participants taking micro breaks to learn the exercise much more quickly than a control group without breaks.

<!-- ## What are optimal rest intervals? -->
<!-- Efficient spacing intervals are in the span of seconds to eeks [KornMeier] -->


## ‚è∞ Why use the MicroBreaks timer?
As opposed to other study timers, most of which employ the Pomodoro method of 25 minutes work, 5 minutes rest, the [MicroBreaks.co](https://www.microbreaks.co) study timer includes micro rests in addition to longer study periods. 
During these micro breaks you stop, close your eyes, and think of nothing for a bit. Deep in your brain, however, many repetions of the stuff you had just been learning are going on, at a staggering 10 to 20 times the speed!
The interval between these mico breaks is random. This avoids you expecting rest and losing focus prematurely. You can easily modify the length and occurence of the micro breaks. 

If you study with microBreaks.co on in the background, and take the small 10 second rests while prompted, you might see spectacular increases in your learning speed!

<!-- This is a non-obvious way to increase repetitions and learn faster. Studies (in humans) have shown that when we are trying to learn something, if we pause every so often for 10seconds and do nothing during the pause, neurons in the hippocampus and cortex‚Äîareas of the brain involved in learning and memory, engage the same patterns of neural activity that occurred during the actual activity of reading, musical practice, skill training, etc. but 10X faster‚Äîmeaning you get 10X neural repetitions completed during the pause. These ‚Äúgap-effects‚Äù are similar to what happens in a deep sleep. The takeaway: randomly introduce 10 second pauses during learning. ‚ÄúHow often?‚Äù I get asked. A ratio of approximately 1 pause per every 2 minutes of learning is good but remember, distributed at random, so not every 2 minutes on the minute. -->

Nervous system - 
language learning, learning math (involve motor component as well.)
Science of neuroplasticity. 
Organ changing itself. How that occurs. (Staggering that it rewires.)


1. What is neuroplasticity?
    * ability to change. Passive or active. 
    Under 25: passive or active, >25, must be active. ()
        Passively is mere exposure, active = dedicated focus. 
    Rewiring occurs during periods of deep sleep / rest. 

    Active plasticity. 
        Experiment. 
        1. Passive exposed to tone. Brain doesnt change
        2. Listen to tone (for reward) -> rewired. So, when paying attention only.
        3. Control.
        [Recanzone & Merzenich 1990s, Kilgard & Merzwenich]

    1. First requirement. You have to be focused and alert. 
    Many elements to focus. Cluster of neurons (nucleus Basalis.)

    Paired playing of particaular tone with stimulation of nucleus basilis - rewired.
    Neurochemical signature of focus in adult brains. Chemicals in brains that allow you to focus and allow brain to rewire.

    Actual rewiring occurs during sleep and sleep-like statues. 
        During sleep: replay (reactivation of neuronal ). Sleep = more repetions.

    In sleep, rehearsing and rewiring brain.

    Excitingly: Also during NSDR (non sleep deep rest).
    Coined term of naps, yoga, etc. Brining in state of relaxation and limiting amount of focus. 

    Cell Reports - Replay of learned neural firing sequences
    Post-training meditation promotes motor memory consolidation - Maarten Immink
    
    In just the last two years, showing that during shallow naps for 20 minutes or so, rapid replay of neural repetitiotns, enhance learning. 
    
    
    Post training meditation paper thing has awesome graph (reaction time 1400 vs 1800 for controls/)

    Excitingly, just last year - consolidation. Briefly ten second breaks. 
    Cell Reports, Buch et al. 2021
    Actively teaching and learning. 
    Doing that randomly greatly enahnces speed and depth of learning. 
    Recording - showed like in deep sleep, rapid replay 10 to 20x the speed. More repetitions. (Gap learning effects. )
    Mimics what happens during deep sleep. 
    Interpractive rest, 

    @25 minutes, introduce the protocol.
