      <description>The Pomodoro Technique is very popular study tool. It divides work time in 25-minute intervals, separated by short breaks. Pomodoro was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s. Originally, the Pomodoro technique employed a kitchen timer. Nowadays, there are many apps and websites providing Pomodoro timers.
However, some might find a working time of 25 minutes a little bit too short. You might notice that, when the 25 minute bell rings, you have just obtained a deep focus mode, and it might be a little bit of a waste to stop there.</description>

      <description>In 1885, the German psychologist Herman Ebinghaus discovered something very peculiar. He was a psychologist who was very interested in the study of memory. In one of his experiments, he compared 38 repetitions over three days, with 68 repetitions all in one go. The result in memory perfomance was the same. So, the time between learning, or spacing interval, seems as important as the time spent studying.
It is well known that more repetitions improve memory.</description>
